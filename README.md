[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/brigadecore/brigade-github-gateway)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/brigadecore/brigade-github-gateway)

This is a work-in-progress
[Brigade 2](https://github.com/brigadecore/brigade/tree/v2)
compatible gateway that can be used to receive events (webhooks) from one or
more [GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/about-apps)
and propagate them into Brigade 2's event bus.

## Installation

The installation for this gateway is multi-part, and not particularly easy, at
least in part because of a potential "chicken and egg" problem. Setting up this
gateway requires a value obtained during the creation of a GitHub App. Setting
up the GitHub App _may_ require the gateway's public IP (if you're not using a
domain or subdomain name instead). We will use an approach of setting up the
GitHub App first, with a placeholder value for the gateway's address, if
necessary, in which case the GitHub App configuration will be revisited after
the gateway is configured and deployed.

Prerequisites:

* A GitHub account

* A Kubernetes cluster:
    * For which you have the `admin` cluster role
    * That is already running Brigade 2
    * Capable of provisioning a _public IP address_ for a service of type
      `LoadBalancer`. (This means you won't have much luck running the gateway
      locally in the likes of kind or minikube unless you're able and willing to
      mess with port forwarding settings on your router, which we won't be
      covering here.)

* `kubectl`, `helm` (commands below assume Helm 3), and `brig` (the Brigade 2
  CLI)

If you want to avoid the aforementioned "chicken and egg" problem, reserving a
domain or subdomain name (for which you control DNS) also helps. If you don't
want to do this or are unable, we'll cover that scenario as well.

### 1. Create a GitHub App

A [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/about-apps) is a
special kind of trusted entity that is "installable" into GitHub repositories to
enable integrations.

This gateway can support multiple GitHub Apps, but these instructions walk you
through the steps for setting up just one.

* Visit https://github.com/settings/apps/new.

* Choose a _globally unique_ __GitHub App name__.
    * When you submit the form, you'll be informed if the name you selected is
      unavailable.

* Set the __Homepage URL__ to
  `https://github.com/brigadecore/brigade-github-gateway`. Really, any URL will
  work, but this is the URL to which users will be directed if they wish to know
  more information about the App, so something informative is best. The URL
  above links to what is presently the best source of information about this
  gateway.

* Set the __Webhook URL__ to 
  `https://<your gateway domain or subdomain name>/events`.
    * If you're not using a domain or subdomain name and want to use a public IP
      here instead, put a placeholder such as `http://example.com/events` here
      for now and revisit this section later after a public IP has been
      established for your gateway.

* Set the __Webhook Secret__ to a complex string. It is, fundamentally, a
  password, so make it strong. If you're personally in the habit of using a password
  manager and it can generate strong passwords for you, consider using that.
  Make a note of this __shared secret__. You will be using this value again in
  another step.

* Under the __Subscribe to events__ section, select any events you wish to
  propagate to Brigade.
    * Note: Selecting additional permissions in the __Repository permissions__
      section adds additional options to the menu of subscribable events.
    * For the examples that follow, you would require the __Watching__
      permission and a subscription to the __Watch__ event.

* Unless you want anyone on GitHub to be able to send events to your gateway,
  toward the bottom of the page, select __Only This account__ to constrain your
  GitHub App to being installed only by repositories in your own account or
  organization. If you select __Any account__ instead, be sure you know what
  you're doing!

* Submit the form.

After submitting the form, find the __App ID__ field and take note. You will be
using this value again in another step.

Under the `Private keys` section of this page, click `Generate a private key`.
After generating, immediately download the new key. _It is your only opportunity
to do so, as GitHub will only save the public half of the key. You will be using
this key in another step._

### 2. Create a Service Account for the Gateway

__Note:__ To proceed beyond this point, you'll need to be logged into Brigade 2
as the "root" user (not recommended) or (preferably) as a user with the `ADMIN`
role. Further discussion of this is beyond the scope of this documentation.
Please refer to Brigade's own documentation.

Using Brigade 2's `brig` CLI, create a service account for the gateway to use:

```console
$ brig service-account create \
    --id brigade-github-gateway \
    --description brigade-github-gateway
```

Make note of the __token__ returned. This value will be used in another step.
_It is your only opportunity to access this value, as Brigade does not save it._

Authorize this service account to read all events and to create new ones:

```console
$ brig role grant READER \
    --service-account brigade-github-gateway

$ brig role grant EVENT_CREATOR \
    --service-account brigade-github-gateway \
    --source brigade.sh/github
```

__Note:__ The `--source brigade.sh/github` option specifies that this service
account can be used _only_ to create events having a value of
`brigade.sh/github` in the event's `source` field. _This is a security measure
that prevents the gateway from using this token for impersonating other gateways._

### 3. Install the GitHub Gateway

For now, we're using the [GitHub Container Registry](https://ghcr.io) (which is
an [OCI registry](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/)) to host our Helm
chart. Helm 3.7 has _experimental_ support for OCI registries. In the event that
the Helm 3.7 dependency proves troublesome for Brigade users, or in the event that
this experimental feature goes away, or isn't working like we'd hope, we will
revisit this choice before going GA.

First, be sure you are using
[Helm 3.7.0-rc.1](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.7.0-rc.1) and
enable experimental OCI support:

```console
$ export HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI=1
```

As this chart requires custom configuration as described above to function
properly, we'll need to create a chart values file with said config.

Use the following command to extract the full set of configuration options into
a file you can modify:

```console
$ helm inspect values oci://ghcr.io/brigadecore/brigade-github-gateway \
    --version v0.3.0 > ~/brigade-github-gateway-values.yaml
```

Edit `~/brigade-github-gateway-values.yaml`, making the following changes:

* `brigade.apiAddress`: Address of the Brigade API server, beginning with
  `https://`

* `brigade.apiToken`: Service account token from step 2

* `github.apps`: Specify the details of your GitHub App(s), including:

    * `appID`: App ID from step 1

    * `apiKey`: The private key downloaded in step 1, beginning
      with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and ending with
      `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`. All line breaks should be preserved and
      the beginning of each line should be indented exactly four spaces.

    * `sharedSecret`: Shared secret from step 1

* `receiver.host`: Set this to the host name where you'd like the gateway to be
  accessible.

Save your changes to `~/brigade-github-gateway-values.yaml` and use the
following command to install the gateway using the above customizations:

```console
$ helm install brigade-github-gateway \
    oci://ghcr.io/brigadecore/brigade-github-gateway \
    --version v0.3.0 \
    --create-namespace \
    --namespace brigade-github-gateway \
    --values ~/brigade-github-gateway-values.yaml
```

### 4. (RECOMMENDED) Create a DNS Entry

In the prerequisites section, we suggested that you reserve a domain or
subdomain name as the address of your gateway. At this point, you should be able
to associate that name with the gateway's public IP address.

If you installed the gateway without enabling support for an ingress controller,
this command should help you find the gateway's public IP address:

```console
$ kubectl get svc brigade-github-gateway-receiver \
    --namespace brigade-github-gateway \
    --output jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
```

If you overrode defaults and enabled support for an ingress controller, you
probably know what you're doing well enough to track down the correct IP without
our help. ðŸ˜‰

With this public IP in hand, edit your name servers and add an `A` record
pointing your domain to the public IP.

__Note:__ If you do not want to use a domain or subdomain name, or are unable
to, and elected to use a placeholder URL when initially setting up your GitHub
App, return to GitHub (your App can be found on GitHub using a URL of the form
`https://github.com/settings/apps/<app name>`) and edit your App's configuration
to send webhooks (events) to `https://<public ip>/events`.

### 5. Confirm Connectivity

Your App can be found on GitHub using a URL of the form
`https://github.com/settings/apps/<app name>`.

Go to the __Advanced__ tab and check out the __Recent Deliveries__ section. Here
you can view events that your GitHub App has recently attempted to deliver to
your new gateway. There shouldn't be many events displayed yet, but there should
be at least one `ping` event that the App attempted to deliver to the gateway
when the App was created. This should have failed since we set up the App on
GitHub's end _prior_ to installing the gateway on our cluster. Click
__Redeliver__. If re-delivery succeeds, you're all set!

If re-delivery failed, you can examine request and response headers and payload
to attempt to make some determination as to what has gone wrong.

Some likely problems include:

* Your A record in DNS is incorrect.

* DNS changes have not propagated.

* Your gateway is not listening on a public IP.

* The __Webhook URL__ you entered when configuring the GitHub App is incorrect.

* The gateway was not configured correctly using the GitHub App's __App ID__
  and __shared secret__.

### 6. Install the App

Your App can be found on GitHub using a URL of the form
`https://github.com/settings/apps/<app name>`.

Under the __Install App__ tab you can see all accounts and organizations into
whose repositories you can install your App. Click the gear icon next to the
desired account or organization and, under __Repository access__ choose __All
repositories__ OR __Only select repositories__ then specify which ones, and
click __Save__.

### 7. Add a Brigade Project

You can create any number of Brigade projects (or modify an existing one) to
listen for events sent from your GitHub App to your gateway and, in turn,
emitted into Brigade's event bus. You can subscribe to all event types emitted
by the gateway, or just specific ones.

In the example project definition below, we subscribe to all events emitted by
the gateway, provided they've originated from the `example-org/example-repo`
repository (see the `repo` qualifier). You should adjust this value to match a
repository into which you have installed your new GitHub App.

```yaml
apiVersion: brigade.sh/v2-beta
kind: Project
metadata:
  id: github-demo
description: A project that demonstrates integration with GitHub
spec:
  eventSubscriptions:
  - source: brigade.sh/github
    types:
    - *
    qualifiers:
      repo: example-org/example-repo
  workerTemplate:
    defaultConfigFiles:
      brigade.js: |-
        const { events } = require("@brigadecore/brigadier");

        events.on("brigade.sh/github", "watch:started", () => {
          console.log("Someone starred the example-org/example-repo repository!");
        });

        events.process();
```

In the alternative example below, we subscribe _only_ to `watch:started` events.
(Note that, counterintuitively, this event occurs when someone _stars_ a
repository; not when they start watching it. This is a peculiarity of GitHub and
not a peculiarity of this gateway.)

```yaml
apiVersion: brigade.sh/v2-beta
kind: Project
metadata:
  id: github-demo
description: A project that demonstrates integration with GitHub
spec:
  eventSubscriptions:
  - source: brigade.sh/github
    types:
    - watch:started
    qualifiers:
      repo: example-org/example-repo
  workerTemplate:
    defaultConfigFiles:
      brigade.js: |-
        const { events } = require("@brigadecore/brigadier");

        events.on("brigade.sh/github", "watch:started", () => {
          console.log("Someone starred the example-org/example-repo repository!");
        });

        events.process();
```

Assuming this file were named `project.yaml`, you can create the project like
so:

```console
$ brig project create --file project.yaml
```

Adding a star to the repo into which you installed your new GitHub App should
now send an event (webhook) from GitHub to your gateway. The gateway, in turn,
will emit the event into Brigade's event bus. Brigade should initialize a worker
(containerized event handler) for every project that has subscribed to the
event, and the worker should execute the `brigade.js` script that was embedded
in the project definition.

List the events for the `github-demo` project to confirm this:

```console
$ brig event list --project github-demo
```

Full coverage of `brig` commands is beyond the scope of this documentation, but
at this point, additional `brig` commands can be applied to monitor the event's
status and view logs produced in the course of handling the event.

## Events Received and Emitted by this Gateway

Events received by this gateway from GitHub are, in turn, emitted into
Brigade's event bus.

Event of certain types received from GitHub are further qualified by the value
of an `action` field. In all such cases, the event emitted into Brigade's event
bus will have a type of the form `<original event type>:<action>`. For instance,
if this gateway receives an event of type `pull_request` from GitHub with the
value `opened` in the `action` field, the event emitted into Brigade's event bus
will be of type `pull_request:opened`.

Events received from GitHub vary in _scope of specificity_. All events handled
by this gateway are _at least_ indicative of activity involving some specific
repository in some way -- for instance, a GitHub user having starred or forked a
repository. Some events, however, are more specific than this, being indicative
of activity involving not only a specific repository, but also some specific
branch, tag, or commit -- for instance, a new pull request has been opened or a
new tag has been pushed. In such cases (and only in such cases), this gateway
includes git reference or commit information in the event that is emitted into
Brigade's event bus. By doing so, Brigade (which has built in _git_ support;
_not GitHub support_) is enabled to locate specific code affected by the event.

If the gateway is able to infer a human-friendly title for any event, the event
emitted into Brigade's event bus is augmented with this information.

The following table summarizes all GitHub event types that can be received by
this gateway and the corresponding event types that are emitted into Brigade's
event bus.
