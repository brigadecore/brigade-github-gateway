## All settings for the receiver
receiver:

  replicas: 1

  ## Host should be set accurately for a variety of reasons. This is used in
  ## ingress resources and cert generation.
  host: localhost:31700

  image:
    repository: brigadecore/brigade-github-gateway-receiver
    ## tag should only be specified if you want to override Chart.appVersion
    ## The default tag is the value of .Chart.AppVersion
    tag: edge
    pullPolicy: Always

  github:
    ## This value should be the same as was specified when creating your GitHub
    ## App that corresponds to this gateway. GitHub will use this secret in
    ## signing webhook payloads and the gateway can use this value to validate
    ## those signatures. This allows the gateway to obtain assurances that a
    ## webhook did indeed originate from GitHub and hasn't been tampered with
    ## in-transit.
    sharedSecret: foobar
    checkSuite:
      ## The author associations who are allowed to have their PR events and
      ## "/brig run" comments trigger the creation of a GitHub CheckSuite.
      ##
      ## Possible values are: COLLABORATOR, CONTRIBUTOR, OWNER, NONE, MEMBER,
      ## FIRST_TIMER, and FIRST_TME_CONTRIBUTOR.
      ##
      ## See https://developer.github.com/v4/enum/commentauthorassociation/
      allowedAuthorAssociations:
      - OWNER

      ## Whether a new GitHub CheckSuite should be created when an authorized
      ## user (see above) opens or amends a PR.
      onPR: true
      ## Whether a new GitHub CheckSuite should be created when an authorized
      ## user (see above) comments "/brig run" on a PR.
      onComment: true

  brigade:
    ## The opt-in list of upstream event types that may be emitted into Brigade.
    ## Defaults to "*" which matches any event type. To emit only specific
    ## events into Brigade, remove "*" and enumerate specific event types
    ## instead (`pull_request:opened`, for instance).
    emittedEvents:
    - "*"

  tls:
    ## Whether to enable TLS. If true then you MUST do ONE of three things to
    ## ensure the existence of a TLS certificate:
    ##
    ## 1. Set generateSelfSignedCert below to true (the default)
    ## 2. OR Set values for BOTH the cert and key fields below
    ## 3. OR create a cert secret named <Helm release name>-receiver-cert in
    ##    the same namespace as Brigade. This secret could be created manually
    ##    or through other means, such as a cert manager.
    enabled: true
    ## Whether to generate a self-signed certificate. If true, a new certificate
    ## will be generated for every revision of the corresponding Helm release.
    ## Since the certificate is self-signed, it will not be trusted by clients
    ## and should absolutely not be used for production, but having this enabled
    ## as a default effectively discourages the more heavy-handed option to
    ## disable TLS entirely. If TLS is enabled and cert generation is DISABLED,
    ## users MUST provide their own cert and private key below OR create a cert
    ## secret named <Helm release name>-receiver-cert in the same namespace as
    ## the gateway.
    generateSelfSignedCert: true
    # cert: base 64 encoded cert goes here
    # key: base 64 encoded key goes here

  ingress:
    ## Whether to enable ingress. By default, this is disabled and the
    ## webhook receiver's service is of type LoadBalancer instead. Enabling
    ## ingress is advanced usage.
    enabled: false
    ## Optionally use annotations specified by your ingress controller's
    ## documentation to customize the behavior of the ingress resource.
    annotations:
      # kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    tls:
      ## Whether to enable TLS. If true then you MUST do ONE of three things to
      ## ensure the existence of a TLS certificate:
      ##
      ## 1. Set generateSelfSignedCert below to true (the default)
      ## 2. OR Set values for BOTH the cert and key fields below
      ## 3. OR create a cert secret named
      ##    <Helm release name>-receiver-ingress-cert in the same namespace as
      ##    the gateway. This secret could be created manually or through other
      ##    means, such as a cert manager.
      ##
      ## Note there is a wide disparity in the feature set of various ingress
      ## controllers and some ingress controllers may be able to provision a
      ## certificate for you even with TLS disabled here. Consult your ingress
      ## controller's documentation.
      enabled: true
      ## Whether to generate a self-signed certificate. If true, a new
